//! Instruction semantics modeling dialect
//!
//! The `isema` dialect provides a set of low-level utilities to model the behavior of particular
//! machine instructions. This can be used for a number of applications:
//! 1. Verify low-level optimizations
//! 2. Emulate the execution of a piece of assembly code
//! 3. Search for new optimization patterns
//!
//! Note, however, that at the moment the dialect only captures the *semantics* of an instruction, and does not
//! advertise any architecture-level details, such as register file. Neither it is targeted at
//! modeling microarchitecture details of a particular platform.
//!
//! The general idea of a dialect is that we can model any program as a set of simple operations
//! that do one of the following things:
//! 1. Update registers with immediate values
//! 2. Perform simple arithmetic operations on registers or immediates
//! 3. Load from and store to memory
//!
//! That means, that the semantics of `addi x6, x7, 42` and `vfadd.s v0, v1, v2` are the same and
//! will be represented by `isema.add` operation, even though nothing is similar about these two
//! instructions from architecture point of view: data type, vector width, use of an immediate.
