# How to Contribute

The contribution guideline is derived from the SlimPHP, Istanbul Code Coverage and Ruby contribution guideline

## Contributor Behavior

Be kind to one another. We're striving to make TIR an inclusive environment that's great for first time open-source contributors.

tldr; we value constructive community interaction, over technical acumen.

## Pull Requests

TIR uses the [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) as main versioning workflow

1. Fork the TIR repository
2. Create a new branch for each feature, fix or improvement
3. Send a pull request from each feature branch to the **main** branch

It is very important to separate new features or improvements into separate feature branches, and to send a
pull request for each branch.

This allow us to review and pull in new features or improvements individually.

## Style Guide

All pull requests SHOULD adhere to the [Conventional Commits specification](https://conventionalcommits.org/)

## A Plea for Lean Software

We value concise and readable code. Please, avoid large pull requests, unnecessary dependencies and 
complicated abstractions. Some good examples of lean software are [tinygrad](https://github.com/tinygrad/tinygrad)
or [llm.c](https://github.com/karpathy/llm.c) from which we take a lot of inspiration. You can also refer
to this blog post to learn more: https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/a-2024-plea-for-lean-software/.

You must agree that your patch will be licensed under the Conventional Commit License, and when we change the license we will assume that you agreed with the change unless you object to the changes in time.
